<P> I have been working since the age of 13. I started babysitting and petsitting at 13. By the age of 16, I nannied after school.

</div>
<P> I also worked as a summer office assistant at AlphaCord, in 2012. </P> 
<P> In 2013, I started working at Five Bar in Athens, Ga. After three months there I became Head Hostess.
 Within this role I trained and scheduled all new hostesses.
 I also was responsible for scheduling all of the resturant's reservations and private events.
 I worked at Five Bar for two years before starting my current job. </P>
<P> I now work as a horseback riding instructor at Pascova Farm. Within this role, I teach weekly lessons to my client base. 
In addition, the farm hosts two annual horse shows and a summer camp. Myself and two other instructors put on the camp each year.
 This involes collecting fees, creating lesson plans, providing a variety of activies and ensuring the safety of all the campers.
 We have a lot of fun putting on the camp each year, but that doesn't mean it isn't a lot of work!  </P>
